# Stock price prediction

## **Overview:**
* Pull and aggregate data from multiple sources
* Feature engineering
* Shift the stock price column by the required number of time points
* Predict future stock price using different machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) methods

## **Script order:**
* get_data.py
* feature_engineering.py
* shift_data.py

After running these in this order, one should have an ML-ready data frame suitable for fitting ML models.
